## Biggest Movers

Here are the top 5 biggest winners and biggest losers. How did your team do?

```{r include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F)
library(tidyverse)
library(glue)
library(rio)
week = 1
current = import('data/current.xlsx',setclass='tibble')
top = current %>%
  arrange(desc(change)) %>% 
  slice_head(n = 5) %>% 
  select(team,change)
bottom = current %>%
  arrange(change) %>% 
  slice_head(n = 5) %>% 
  select(team,change)
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(top, caption = "Top 5 weekly change",format = 'markdown')
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(bottom, caption = "Bottom 5 weekly change", format = 'markdown')
```

```{r, results = 'asis'}
cat(glue("## All Teams Week {week}"))
```

```{r, results = 'asis'}
cat(glue("![all teams week {week}](../CFBAnimation/figures/week{week}sppcfb.png)"))
```

```{r, results = 'asis'}
cat(glue("## All Teams Week {week} Animated"))
```

```{r, results = 'asis'}
cat(glue("![all teams week {week} animated](../CFBAnimation/figures/CFBEfficiency-week{week}.gif)"))
```

# Conferences

*Preseason ratings are shown using smaller logos

```{r, results='asis'}
conferences = c("ACC", "American Athletic", "Big 12", "Big Ten", "Conference USA", 
"FBS Independents", "Mid-American", "Mountain West", "Pac-12", 
"SEC", "Sun Belt")
for(conf in conferences){
  cat(glue("\n\n## {conf} week {week}\n\n"),sep = "\n")
  cat(glue("\n\n![{conf} week {week}](../CFBAnimation/figures/week{week}sppcfb-{conf}.png)\n\n"),sep = "\n")
}
```
