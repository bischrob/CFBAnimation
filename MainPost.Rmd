This post has been updated for week `r weeks[which.max(weeks)]` (see the original post text [here](https://bischrob.github.io/CFBAnimation/WeeklyPost-week1)).

This post contains static and animated charts showing the offensive and defensive weekly ratings for all FBS teams together and static charts by conference (using [SP+](https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2017/10/13/16457830/college-football-advanced-stats-analytics-rankings)---see link for details; link has been updated with no paywall).

You can see all the charts in one place at this [link](../CFBAnimation/MainPost).

## All Teams

```{r, results = 'asis'}
for(week in weeks){
  cat(glue("\n\n![all teams week {week}](../CFBAnimation/figures/week{week}sppcfb.png)\n\n"),.sep = "\n")
}
```

## All Teams Animated

```{r, results = 'asis'}
  cat(glue("\n\n![all teams week {week}](../CFBAnimation/figures/CFBEfficiency-week{max(weeks)}.gif)\n\n"),.sep = "\n")
```

# Conferences

*Prior week's ratings are shown using smaller logos

```{r, results='asis'}
conferences = c("ACC", "American Athletic", "Big 12", "Big Ten", "Conference USA", 
                "FBS Independents", "Mid-American", "Mountain West", "Pac-12", 
                "SEC", "Sun Belt")

for(conf in conferences){
  for(week in weeks){
    cat(glue("\n\n## {conf} week {week}\n\n"),sep = "\n")
    cat(glue("\n\n![{conf} week {week}](../CFBAnimation/figures/week{week}sppcfb-{conf}.png)\n\n"),sep = "\n")
  }
}
```
