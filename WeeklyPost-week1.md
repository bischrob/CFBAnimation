## Biggest Movers

Here are the top 5 biggest winners and biggest losers. How did your team do?




Table: Top 5 weekly change

|team               | change|
|:------------------|------:|
|Georgia State      |   12.3|
|Arizona            |    9.8|
|Georgia Southern   |    9.2|
|Jacksonville State |    9.0|
|Louisiana Monroe   |    8.4|


Table: Bottom 5 weekly change

|team             | change|
|:----------------|------:|
|Middle Tennessee |   -8.4|
|Indiana          |   -7.9|
|Miami (OH)       |   -7.9|
|North Texas      |   -7.7|
|LSU              |   -7.6|

That's right the team of the week is the Georgia State Panthers with an epic seven-point victory over the---checks notes---Rhode Island Rams. If you have a hard time finding them on the charts, just look for the mighty Colorado Buffaloes because they're apparently rated pretty evenly (I'm not in charge of these ratings).

Somehow Middle Tennessee State losing to Alabama caused their rating to crash while giving Alabama a tremendous boost to number one overall. I can't figure that one either.

What stands out to you after week 1 (and week 0 I guess)?
